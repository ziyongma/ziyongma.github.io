I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), with an expected graduation in May 2026. My research interests span **Embodied AI**, **Spatial Intelligence**, **3D Reconstruction and Understanding** and **Spatial Data Infrastrutre**, with additional focus on **Machine Learning for Healthcare**.

I am currently conducting research at both the **Computer Science Department** and the **Robotics Institute** at CMU. Within the Computer Science Department, under the supervision of **Prof. Srinivasan Seshan** and **Prof. Anthony Rowe**, I serve as a research assistant at WiSELab focuses on **large-scale spatial data infrastructure** and **spatial data understanding using multimodal large language models (MLLMs)**. At the Robotics Institute, I am jointly supervised by **Prof. Jean Oh** and **Prof. Jeffrey Ichnowski**, conducting research on **3D reconstruction**, **world models**, and **soft robotics**.

Previously, I was a research assistant at DropLab at CMU , supervised by Prof. Matthew Johnson-Roberson and Dr. Weiming Zhi, where I focused on 3D reconstruction from single-view images and path planning in 3D environments. I also worked at the DIG Lab in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at CMU, supervised by Prof. Adam Perer, conducting research on machine learning systems for healthcare.

Besides research, I’m a big basketball enthusiast 🏀 and an avid fan of travel 🌏 and photography 📷!

I am actively seeking opportunities for internships and graduate school. Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:ziyongm@andrew.cmu.com">email</a>.
